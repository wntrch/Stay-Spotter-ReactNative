Reflection
StaySpotter Mobile was developed as a four-week project while learning the fundamentals of React Native module. The primary objectives were to utilize the knowledge and technologies acquired so far and to familiarize myself with the latest features of the React Native ecosystem.

The project utilizes React Native, React Navigation 5.x, Redux, and JavaScript. I chose the create-react-native-app command to reduce initial setup time and to allocate more resources towards feature development within the application.

In the upcoming phase, I intend to enhance the user interface for optimized responsiveness on mobile devices, integrate an advanced search functionality, and implement a backend portion to the app. This is in line with my goal to provide an excellent mobile-centric experience for our users.
